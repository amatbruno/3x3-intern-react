# 3x3_Intern Project

The 3x3 Intern project is an educational and non-lucrative project where is used to learn and practice with design and functional technologies like;
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript (React.js)
 - Node.js
 - PostgreSQL

This project has been created with the Vite framework.

It's important to understand that possibly exists some code bad practices or desing fails but is made it 100% to understant how works an entire full-stack webpage.

1.Running project
- First, Node.js needs to be installed  on your PC, then download the project and intiate it in a splitted console;
  - Type;
  ```html
<pre>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="block two first">
            <div class="wrap">
            npm install
            npm run dev
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</pre>
  ```
  - And, if you want to test the database, follow this steps a second terminal (I will provide the database connection properly);
    ```html
